Conversation Nodes --> how to handle each request
Conversation nodes define how the chatbot responds and if actions are required.
  1. Ask a question: get a input from user
  2. Add a condition: Add branching logic
  3. Call an action : Call Power Automate Flows
  4. Show a message : How the chatbot reply to a user
  5. End with survey: Conversation ends, a survey appears
